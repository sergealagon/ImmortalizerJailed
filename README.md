# ImmortalizerJailed

Keep your apps running in the foreground indefinitely, even if they are in the background!

**For iOS 14 and above, [download here](https://github.com/sergealagon/ImmortalizerJailed/releases/)**

_This is the jailed version of the tweak [Immortalizer](https://github.com/sergealagon/Immortalizer) that can be injected on any IPA, **without the need of jailbreak or TrollStore!**_

### Installation
1. No need for jailbreak or TrollStore, so all you have to do is inject the dylib to an IPA you want this to work.
2. You may use any tools like **Sideloadly**, **E-Sign**, or even **TrollFools** to inject the dylib.

### Details
- Just like the tweak, it can make apps stay in the foreground, however, you need to inject this onto the app you want to immortalize. 
- There would be a **floating movable button** that you can press to toggle Immortalizer
- Just like the TrollStore version, there's no way to force notifications. It's a bit tricky to force notifications to show, especially for apps that render their own notification UI when their app is opened (e.g. WhatsApp).
